You do not see the Yellow River water from the sky
running to the sea no return
Don't you see gao tang mirror sad white hair
such as green twilight into snow
Life must be happy
do not make gold bottle empty on the moon
Born my material will be useful
a thousand gold dispersed also come back
Three hundred cups are required for the pleasure of cooking sheep and slaughtering cattle
